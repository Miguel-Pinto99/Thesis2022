# Thesis project from Miguel Pinto 2022

## Description

Repository which contains all the work developed during my thesis. The project consists of a dynamic dashboard for an autonomous research vehicle of the University of Aveiro. The information relative to the car was present at the CAN-Bus of the vehicle. Therefore a ROS node was responsible for receiving and decrying it. Then the information was published to a topic which is then subscribed by the dashboard software. As the software feeds the dashboard with information, an interactive display kept the driver updated on the vehicleâ€™s current state.
