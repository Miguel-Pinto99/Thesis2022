# Thesis project from Miguel Pinto 2022

## Description

Repository which contains all the work developed during my thesis. The project consists of a dynamic dashboard for an autonomous research vehicle of the University of Aveiro. The information relative to the car was present at the CAN-Bus of the vehicle. Therefore a ROS node was responsible for receiving and decrying it. Then the information was published to a topic which is then subscribed by the dashboard software. As the software feeds the dashboard with information, an interactive display kept the driver updated on the vehicleâ€™s current state.

## Deployment

To run the application, the following software/libraries are needed

```
1- ROS - Robotic Operating System (Communication protocol)
2- can-utils (To get the data from the CAN bus)
3- Kivy (To launch the front-end)
```

## Launch

Run the package in the termal using the launch file:

```
